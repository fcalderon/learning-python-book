# Chapter 4 - Introducing Python Object Types

- "Things to do stuff" -
"things" operations
"stuff" objects


- Python programs can be decomposed into modules, statements, expressions and
objects

- Programs are composed of modules
- Modules contain statements
- Statements contain expressions
- Expressions create and process objects


## On Python is "dynamically typed" but also "strongly typed"

This means that although Python manages types for you, you can only perform
valid operations on types. For example, lists operations can only be applied to
list type objects, and string operations can only be performed on string type
objects.

In Lutz's words:

> Python is ***dynamically typed***, a model that *keeps track of types for you
automatically* instead of requiring declaration code, but it is also
***strongly typed***, a constraint that means you can perform on an object *only
operations that are valid for its type*

**whet** a thing that stimulates appetite or desire.
