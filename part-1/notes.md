## On "Why Do People Use Python?"

### Software Quality

Based on the book, one of the reasons people use Python is because of software
quality. The book claims Python is focused on readability, coherence, and
software quality. Software quality is such a vague term, however. Does the
author refer to the quality/stability of a running program? Or does the author
refer to the quality of the source?

The author also says Python is designed to be Readable, reusable and
maintainable. However, the lack of static types and cool one-line tricks Python
posses make this argument hard to believe when creating applications at scale.
The fact that the author later says this in comparison to traditional scripting
languages, makes me think that although these statements are true, when compared
to other programming languages Python might be less readable, usable and
maintainable, making code bases harder to scale and navigate. I'm eager to learn
more about this topic throughout the course of the book, as there might be
more to it than the author can say in this one paragraph.

The author dives a bit deeper into this topic in the following section and sheds
some more light to it. One phrase in particular that caught my attention was
"Explicit is better than implicit". I had to dive deeper into this to see what
it meant in practice and came across a very basic example on a [piece](https://miguelgfierro.com/blog/2018/python-pro-tips-understanding-explicit-is-better-than-implicit/)
in the web which help me better understand what the author was referring to.
I agree with this statement a lot, and have been practicing being explicit for
years. I must have learned it somewhere or leaned towards naturally since it is
so straight forward why explicit rules over implicitness when writing and
reading code.

The author also mentions OOP and functional programming, which definitely help
with code readability and maintainability.

### Developer Productivity

This definitely makes sense. The author correctly claims that Python is much
less compared to languages like Java when writing similar applications. But I
can't help to feel that verbosity many times is good in order to make things
more readable (and hence maintainable) when used effectively. Lack of having to
compile the code definitely helps with productivity though, as developers run
through many cycles of writing and debugging and every second counts.

## On "Is Python a "Scripting Language"?

#### The author's definition for Python

I really liked this definition:

> Python is a general purpose programming language that blends procedural,
> functional and object oriented paradigms.


One could say that Python takes the best of the three worlds.
